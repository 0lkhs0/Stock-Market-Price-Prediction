# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction

Learning Machine Learning.
Mini project on predicting stocks prices using RandomForrestClassifier.

In this case, using yahoo finance api to obtain a time series dataset on a specific ticker which is (S&P500). Using RFC and backtesting to predict if the prices will go up or down.

With just a time series data, i only managed to obtain a confidence of 0.5688. While it is really not satisfactory, it is a good learning experience and mini project.
